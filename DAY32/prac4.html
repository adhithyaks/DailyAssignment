 <h2 id="topic1">States</h2>

 <p>Indian States and Capitals: India is the seventh largest country in the world and 
    also the second most populous. It lies in southern Asia. It is officially known as 
    the Republic of India. It is governed by a parliamentary form of government.
    It gets very difficult to manage a large country from one place.</p>


    <p>So Indian Constitution gives the right to the central government to make states feel suitable.
        There are 28 states and 8 Union territories in our country India</p>

 <h2 id="topic2">Culture</h2>

 <p>Culture of India is a term that encompasses the diverse customs, values, traditions, 
    and religions of the people who live in the Indian subcontinent and its diaspora123. 
    It is one of the oldest and richest cultures in the world, dating back to ancient times245. 
    </p>

    <p>It is influenced by varied geographical conditions, ancient scriptures, and historical events125.

 <h2 id="topic3">Language</h2>

 <p>There is no national language (Rashtra Bhasa) in the Republic of India.
    However, article 343(1) of the Indian constitution specifically mentions that 
    "The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script. 
    </p>

    <p>The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union shall be the international 
        form of Indian numerals,"while clause 3 of the Official Languages Act, 1963 mentions the 
        "Continuation of English Language for official purposes of the Union and for use in Parliament", 
        so English and Hindi are the Official Languages (Raj Bhasa) of the Government of India</p>

 <h2 id="topic4">Literacy</h2>

 <p>Literacy in India is a key for social-economic progress.[2][3] The 2011 census, indicated a 2001–2011 literacy growth of 97.2%, which is slower than the growth seen during the previous decade. An old analytical 1990 study estimated that it would take until 2060 for India to achieve universal literacy at then-current rate of progress.[4]</p>
 <p>Census of India pegged the average literacy rate to be 73% in 2011 while National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18. Literacy rate in urban areas was 87.7%, higher than rural areas with 73.5%. There is a wide gender disparity in the literacy rate in India and effective literacy rates (age 7 and above) was 84.7% for men and 70.3% for women.[5] The low female literacy rate has a dramatically negative impact on family planning and population stabillisation efforts in India. Studies have indicated that female literacy is a strong predictor of the use of contraception among married Indian couples, even when women do not otherwise have economic independence.[6] The census provided a positive indication that growth in female literacy rates (11.8%) was substantially faster than in male literacy rates (6.9%) in the 2001–2011 decadal period, which means the gender gap appears to be narrowing.[7]</p>

 <h2 id="topic5">Festivals</h2>

 <p>India is a land of diversification. Every state has its unique art, culture and tradition. The one thing that is common for all states is the celebration of individual culture and tradition.

    Indians celebrate their beliefs, culture and tradition in the form of festivals. Every festival has its own specific characteristics. Festivals in India are celebrated season-wise and state-wise.
    
    </p>

    <p>The main reason for the celebration of these festivals is to spread happiness and strengthen the bond between friends and family. Many festivals are local and are held on different dates each year. A few are set according to the lunar calendar. The relevance of festivals in India is to honour a deity at a particular temple, celebrate the agriculture cycle or a religious story or event.
    
        This article gives detailed information about all the Indian festivals of different states.</p>
